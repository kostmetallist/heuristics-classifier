# Heuristics Classifier
MMXX course work project (MSU CMC, ISP RAS).

### About
This project's goal is to provide implementation for heuristic-based dependency 
inference mechanisms aimed at event log data. Specific procedures are presented 
in order to analyze log information, generate a model of attributes' domains 
representation, and build a graph data structure to detect possible event classes 
and their correlations.

### Running the application
`./run.sh` on Unix systems or `start.bat` on Windows.

### Troubleshooting
Please leave your suggestions and bug reports at 
[issues page](https://github.com/kostmetallist/heuristics-classifier/issues).
