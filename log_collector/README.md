### Building 
Use either the simplified `go run` to directly execute a program or `go build` command to generate an executable for deferred launch. One may want to choose from two commands listed below assuming `root.go` represents an entry point which should be used as an argument for `go run` expression: 

* `go run root.go`
* `go build -o root`

### Cleaning out
If you have followed instructions to build an executable, merely do `go clean` in the project root directory.
